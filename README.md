# List-lang-prototype

Prototype repo for testing potential reactive list based language backend and functionality.

## Intro

This repo is an xcode project used for testing and implementing a reaction-based programming language.
A reaction based programming language is one that focuses on low-level, loosely abstracted interactions between elements, where strict
divisions of types like classes or functions is not defined.

In fact, the purpose here is to develop a prototype that is really mono-typed. Where there are just lists of elements that react with one another.
